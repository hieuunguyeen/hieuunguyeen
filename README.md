### Hi there 👋

My name is Hieu Nguyen, but people call me James too!

I'm a highly adaptable, comfortably multi-tasking person and a geek at heart who is always curious for everything techy.
Still on the path to learning more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Serverless, NodeJs, all things AWS and plenty of architecting for a Finnish Startup name MaaS Global :)
- 🌱 Currently learning Kubernetes, Golang
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some Go projects, that would be fun
- ⚡ Aside from coding, I like 🎮video games, 🎣fishing, 🍸cocktails, ☕coffee and cats 🐈

### Hi there 👋

My name is Hieu Nguyen, but people call me James too!

I'm a highly adaptable, comfortably multi-tasking person and a geek at heart who is always curious for everything techy.
Still on the path to learning more.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Serverless, NodeJs, all things AWS, some containers, some Jenkins, plenty of architecting for a Finnish Startup name MaaS Global :)
- 👷‍♂️ If you have some freelancing works, some fun side gigs, hit me up!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes, Golang and en route to my getting my AWS Solution Architect Professional certificate 🙌
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some Go projects, that would be fun
- ⚡ Aside from coding, I like 🎮video games, 🎣fishing, 🍸bartending (cocktails) and cats 🐈
- 📺 I have a [Youtube channel in Vietnamese](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9SJtNKG5dwHSSavJfszrOg), where I'm making vlogs sometimes for fun just talking about things that I'm interested in.
